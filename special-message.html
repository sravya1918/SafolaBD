    <h1>❤️ A Special Message for You! ❤️</h1>
    <p>To my dearest friend Safiya (aka Safola Masala Oats, Safayi, Apsara Pencil, and all your other creative names we've given you 😄),</p>
    
    <p>I still remember when we first met two years ago. Back then, we weren’t that close, but everything changed in the second year. That’s when I started sharing so much with you—things I’ve never shared with anyone else, even personal stuff. Over time, you became one of my closest and best friends, someone I can truly and deeply trust. 💖</p>
    
    <p>Of course, we’ve had our moments—we cursed, quarreled—but no matter what, we always end up finding our way back to each other. That’s just how strong our bond is. 🤝 We’ve shared not only happiness but also sadness, and that’s what makes our friendship so special. 🌈</p>
    
    <p>And let’s not forget all the times we roasted you! 🔥 (I know we’re the best at that, right? 😜) Even if you think I should apologize, sorry, but don’t expect those from us—especially me. I was born to irritate you and roast you, and I’ll happily keep doing it! 😎</p>
    
    <p>Before I end, here’s some advice for you: Get used to studying the night before the exam 📚, but also try to start studying a little earlier. I truly wish that you achieve all the goals you’ve set for yourself. 🌟 And may our bond always stay this strong! 💪</p>
    
    <p>On this special day, 🎉 Happy Birthday, Safiya! 🎂 I hope your year ahead is filled with love, laughter, success, and unforgettable moments. You deserve all the happiness in the world. 🌟💝</p>
    
    <p>You’re stuck with me for life now, Safola. Thank you for being the amazing friend that you are. Here's to many more memories, laughs, and, of course, roasts! 😂</p>
    
    <p>Also, I wish you’ll be the first one to get married in our batch 💍 (don’t forget to invite me! 🎊).</p>
    
    <p>Forever your annoying and loyal friend.</p>
